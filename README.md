# DiscordEmbeddedGodot

A Godot plugin/library to interact with the Discord Embedded App SDK from Web builds, with zero effort!

Documentation available in [the wiki](https://github.com/kuylar/discord-embedded-godot/wiki)

This is the Godot 3 version of the SDK. Switch to the `godot-4` branch to use the Godot 4 version instead.

For support, you can visit our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zHydENpSbr) and head to the #godot-discord-sdk-discussion channel.

> [!NOTE]
> Godot 4 builds will not work in Discord if you have thread support enabled. To disable threading, either use Godot 3 or use Godot 4.3 beta versions
